# GM_Tools
This will be a simple .Net application to help me with various aspects of running a D&amp;D game that I have trouble with.

## The Problem:
I run a home-brewed D&D campaign.  My players often want more details about the townsfolk they meet than I can come up with on the fly.

## Proposed Solution:
Create a simple, easy to use program that will generate these townsfolk for me.

## Supporting Documentation:
- [REQUIREMENTS document](/doc/REQUIREMENTS.md)  Holds a log of the requirements both functional and technical for this project.
- [ARCHITECTURE document](/doc/ARCHITECHURE.md)  Holds the Architectural design documentation for the project.
