#Architecture

First, we'll define our static design.  This will include diagrams and descriptions of the different components that will form our GM_Tools solution.

Second, we'll begin the detailed design of each component.

Third, We'll cross reference our components with each other to identify their dependencies.  This exercise will help us determine which components need to be built at a higher priority than others.

## Static Design

## Detailed Designs
We'll likely do these detailed designs inside the application, then document them here as we go.

## Dependency Assessment
Once the basic building blocks have been added to our application, we'll document who depends on what here.
