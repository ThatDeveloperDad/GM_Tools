#Architecture

First, we'll define our static design.  This will include diagrams and descriptions of the different components that will form our GM_Tools solution.

Second, we'll begin the detailed design of each component.

Third, We'll cross reference our components with each other to identify their dependencies.  This exercise will help us determine which components need to be built at a higher priority than others.

## Static Design
We'll come back to this once we have an idea of what our application needs to do for us. 

## Detailed Designs
We can't do details until we have an idea of what we'll be building.

## Dependency Assessment
Nothing here yet.  This depends on the earlier two steps.
